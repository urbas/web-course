# Web Development Course

## Lesson 1
Let's start with [Khan Academy's "Drawing with Code" lesson].

Once we're finished with that, we'll dive into our project. We'll create a profile page for a random person.

Open up [the online editor].


## Lesson 2
We'll start where we finished in the last session.

If you don't have your own page from the last lesson, you can use this one: [lesson2/profile-page.html]
